# Coding-1-Final
 This website is about me. The pcitures i chose all represents me as a person. There is a picture of Vietnam and its flag. This represents where i am from. I also added a picture of Vietnamese food which is one of my favorite. The other picture i added was a map of Tennessee because that is where i live. I made everything kind of girly with the background pink. This is very colorful. The font is Monospace because i like how it looks because it looks like a typewriter. I tired my best for it to be very pleasing to the eye, and i Believe i have achieved that. Thank you and have a Nice DAy.
