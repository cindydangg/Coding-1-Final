<p>This is the Vietnam Flag. I was born in Vietnam, and then i moved to the United States when I was three. I was born in the city of Saigon or also known as Ho Chi Minh City, the capital city. 
A very fun story I have when we first rode the plane here was when my mom got stuck in the airplane bathroom because she didn't know how to work the sliding door. It was really scaring moving to a whole new country.
It was going to be our new home, and it was especially hard when we didn't know how to speak English. After a couple years, my mom opened her own business, and it's not so scary anymore. We were going to go last summer, but Covid prevented that from happening.
Hopefully we'll be able to go this year.
